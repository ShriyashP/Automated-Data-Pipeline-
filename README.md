Automated Data Pipeline: API to SQL Database
📄 Project Overview
This project is an automated data pipeline designed to fetch, clean, and transfer data seamlessly from the Instagram API to an SQL database. The pipeline allows for real-time data updates, providing a solid foundation for monitoring social media metrics and analyzing trends efficiently.

🛠️ Features
Automated Data Retrieval: Regularly pulls data from Instagram’s API.
Data Cleaning: Formats and sanitizes data for consistency.
SQL Integration: Inserts or updates data in a SQL database.
Scheduling: Automates data pulls using scheduling tools like cron or task schedulers.
Real-Time Data: Provides continuous updates to keep insights current.

🚀 Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
SQL Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)
Instagram API Access: Ensure you have a valid API key.
Step-by-Step Setup
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-pipeline.git
cd data-pipeline
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up Environment Variables: Create a .env file in the project directory with the following:

plaintext
Copy code
API_KEY=your_instagram_api_key
